![Comparsion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mezhgano/posy-cursors-alt/main/_Posy%20Cursors%20Alt%20Preview.png)

This set of cursors is slightly modified version of original, beautiful Posy's cursors. The whole idea was just to remove a line from all pointer and size cursors to achieve more minimal look.
